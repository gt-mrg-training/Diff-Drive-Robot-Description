# Diff-Drive-Robot-Description

A ROS2 package publishing the description for a differential drive robot. Most of the code comes from part of the following tutorial: https://articulatedrobotics.xyz/mobile-robot-2-concept-urdf/. 

To view the URDF in RVIZ, run the rsp.launch.py file. Then open RVIZ from a separate terminal; select "add", then "RobotModel"; for the "description topic" enter robot_description. Also make sure your fixed frame is base_link.
